# README: Symptom-Based Disease Prediction  

## Overview  
**Symptom-Based Disease Prediction** is a machine learning application that predicts diseases based on user-reported symptoms. It uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for symptom extraction and a **Neural Network** for classification. The app is built with **Streamlit** for user interaction.  

## Features  
- Extracts symptoms from user input using NLP techniques.  
- Matches symptoms with predefined medical terms.  
- Uses a trained neural network model for disease prediction.  
- Provides an interactive **Streamlit** interface for easy use.
